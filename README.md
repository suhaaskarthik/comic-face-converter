# Comic face translator

This repository consists of two files. One that trains and designs the architecture of the pix2pix GAN all from scratch using Tensorflow
The other file that uses the weights of the trained model and applies the comic face generator to any given image

This code was all trained through kaggle, due to which the files provided are connected via kaggle, the dataset also available in this kaggle notebook (https://www.kaggle.com/code/suhaaskarthikeyan/comic-generation)
The other file which produces the image has this link (https://www.kaggle.com/code/suhaaskarthikeyan/comic-generation-w-image)
